# 8-Week Schedule (Daily)

90 minutes/day, 6 days/week, 1 rest day. Each day: Coding (45m) + System Design (30m) + Debrief (15m).

## Week 1 — Baseline & Foundations
- Coding: Hash/Two Sum, Sliding Window basics; focus on traces and complexity fluency.
- System Design: latency/throughput math, Little's Law drills, availability equations.
- Debrief: start mistake log; record timing per problem.

## Week 2 — Data Structures & Caching
- Coding: BFS/graphs, Intervals. Time-box to 25m per medium.
- System Design: caching/LB/queues; compute η, ρ; stampede mitigations.
- Mock 1 (end of week): 35m system design on URL shortener.

## Week 3 — DP/Topo & Storage
- Coding: DP (rolling), Topological sort; add 1 hard problem mid-week.
- System Design: sharding/replication/quorums; pick N/R/W configs and narrate tradeoffs.
- Debrief themes: edge cases missed, communication gaps.

## Week 4 — Observability & Reliability
- Coding: Heaps/greedy; mixed review set across archetypes.
- System Design: observability, reliability, security; design SLOs and alerting.
- Mock 2: messaging system; emphasize failure modes and backpressure.

## Week 5 — Cloud Mapping & Costs
- Coding: Two mixed mediums per day; enforce 10m for testcases before coding.
- System Design: cloud service mapping, cost/latency tiers, egress math.
- Deliverable: personal playbook of “default stacks” for common problems.

## Week 6 — Case Studies & Incident Thinking
- Coding: alternate easy+hard sets to practice pacing.
- System Design: walk through bit.ly, WhatsApp, payments; calculate QPS/storage/live cache sizes.
- Mock 3: payments or booking; drive idempotency, consistency choices.

## Week 7 — Full-Length Reps
- Coding: 1 easy warmup + 1 medium/hard timed daily.
- System Design: 45m full mocks with follow-up questions; rotate interviewers if possible.
- Debrief: refine intro template and “closing recap” script.

## Week 8 — Polish & Recovery
- Coding: light review; focus on weak archetypes only.
- System Design: 2-3 mocks; add a war-story snippet to each design.
- Meta: sleep, pacing, talk track; update cheat sheets and mistake log; taper intensity before interviews.
