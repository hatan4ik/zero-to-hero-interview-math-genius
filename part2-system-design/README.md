# System Design — Zero to Hero

Mathematical foundations + real-world patterns + war stories = interview confidence.

## Learning Path
1. **Foundations** — Latency math, throughput engineering, availability calculations
2. **Core Infrastructure** — Caching strategies, load balancing, message queues  
3. **Data Layer** — Sharding math, replication patterns, consistency models
4. **Operations** — Observability, reliability engineering, security frameworks
5. **Cloud Mapping** — AWS/GCP/Azure service equivalents with cost models
6. **Case Studies** — Real numbers from bit.ly, WhatsApp, YouTube, Stripe, Airbnb scale
7. **Failure Engineering** — Circuit breakers, chaos patterns, incident response
8. **Modern Patterns** — Event sourcing, service mesh, serverless, data mesh
9. **War Stories** — Real outages, scaling disasters, lessons learned

## Tools & Calculators
- **capacity_calculator.py** — Little's Law, cache sizing, cost estimation
- **estimation_framework.md** — 10-minute systematic approach  
- **tradeoff_decisions.md** — Decision trees for architecture choices

## Success Metrics
- Estimate within 2x of actual numbers for known systems
- Identify 3+ applicable patterns per problem in <5 minutes  
- Complete system design in 35-40 minutes with deep dives
- Score 3.5+/4.0 on mock interview rubrics

## Interview Authenticity
Replace "typically we would..." with "when I designed X at Y, we discovered..."  
Use specific numbers: "cache hit ratios below 85% indicate poor key design"  
Reference real incidents: "similar to the 2019 GitHub outage caused by..."
