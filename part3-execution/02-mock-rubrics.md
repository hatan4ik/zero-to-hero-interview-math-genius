# Mock Rubrics

## Coding (score 1–4)
- **Understanding:** Restates the problem/constraints, asks for clarifications, identifies edge cases.
- **Approach:** Chooses an appropriate pattern, explains why it fits, outlines steps before coding.
- **Correctness:** Covers core logic and edge cases; tests with sample and corner inputs.
- **Complexity:** States time/space and tradeoffs; can justify choices (e.g., hash vs sort).
- **Communication:** Narrates intent while coding; concise, structured, keeps interviewer in the loop.

## System Design (score 1–4)
- **Requirements:** Captures functional/non-functional needs, scale/SLA targets, success metrics.
- **Estimation:** Back-of-envelope QPS/storage/hotset numbers; identifies bottlenecks.
- **Architecture:** Clear high-level diagram; correct placement of caches/LB/queues/data stores.
- **Scalability/Reliability:** Sharding/replication/quorum choices; failover, backpressure, degradation modes.
- **Ops/Cost:** Observability plan, deployment/rollout, cost drivers/optimizations.
- **Communication:** Structured flow (clarify → estimate → design → deep dive → risks); trades-offs articulated.
